# Comparative Analysis of OCR Models: Surya vs. GCP

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of two Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modelsâ€”**Surya** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**â€”in extracting text from images. The goal is to determine which model provides more accurate and readable results.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted based on:
- **Accuracy**: How closely the extracted text matches the original.
- **Error Types**: Common mistakes in the extracted text.
- **Readability**: How clear and structured the text is.
- **Consistency**: Frequency of errors across different samples.

## Findings
### ðŸ”¹ GCP OCR
- Common errors: **Unnecessary spaces** between words.
- Formatting issues: Words were sometimes broken incorrectly.
- Consistency: Frequent errors affecting reliability.

### ðŸ”¹ Surya OCR
- Better word structuring with **fewer spacing issues**.
- Higher readability and usability.
- Less need for post-processing.
- Some perfect extractions, proving superior accuracy.

## Conclusion
Surya **outperforms** GCP in text extraction, offering better readability and structure. While GCP requires more post-processing, Surya delivers more accurate and usable results.
